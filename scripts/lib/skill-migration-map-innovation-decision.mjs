    ],
    method: [
      '1. **Re-derive the gap from the landscape, not from one paper.** A gap is a statement about the field, so it must rest on the multi-work picture (settled vs contested results, method families). If the search has not reached saturation, say so before claiming anything is unresolved.',
      '2. **Classify each candidate gap by type.** An untested assumption; a contradiction between works; a limitation the authors themselves admit; a capability that exists but not under this setting; a problem no method addresses at all. The type determines what evidence would close the gap.',
      '3. **Test each gap for resolution before recording it.** Search recent literature specifically for work that already addresses it. A gap that has been closed and merely not read is not a gap — record the closest existing work next to every claimed gap.',
      '4. **Separate structural from incidental gaps.** A gap that persists across many groups and settings is structural; one that exists because a single paper used a small dataset is incidental. Structural gaps support a contribution; incidental ones support at most a paper.',
      '5. **Name the mechanism that produces the gap.** "No method handles X" is a description; "existing methods assume Y, which fails when X" is a mechanism, and it predicts what a solution must change. Prefer mechanistic gap statements.',
      '6. **Rank by consequence, not by ease of filling.** For each gap state what becomes possible if it is closed and which existing result would be overturned. A gap that changes nothing measurable is not worth a project.',
      '7. **Record contradiction pairs explicitly.** When two works disagree, keep both citations and state the condition under which each could be right — that condition is frequently the research question.',

      'Every gap must cite the works that define the boundary of current capability plus the closest work that approaches it. Contradiction claims must cite both sides.

Mechanism diversity is what makes the later portfolio decision meaningful.',
      '3. **Force cross-domain transfer to declare itself.** For at least one candidate per gap, name the source field and the imported mechanism, then state what must be re-derived for the import to be valid. Unexamined analogy is the most common source of fake novelty.',
      '4. **Check the closest work while writing the idea, not after.** If you cannot name what differs from the nearest existing method and why that difference should matter, drop the candidate rather than keeping it with vague novelty language.',
      '5. **State the falsifiable claim for each idea.** Write the observation that would show it does not work. An idea whose claim cannot fail is not researchable; it is a programme of work.',
      '6. **Keep the idea separate from its implementation.** Record mechanism and claim only. Architecture, dataset and schedule belong to planning, and committing to them now silently deletes alternatives.',
