      '2. **Report uncertainty with every number.** Give per-seed values, a mean with standard deviation or confidence interval, and the number of runs. A bare mean cannot support a difference claim; prefer uncertainty on the difference over uncertainty on each method separately.',
      '3. **Test the difference where the design allows.** Use paired comparisons across seeds or splits, report effect size alongside the test statistic, correct for multiple comparisons when many pairs are tested, and use non-parametric tests when the sample is small or normality is doubtful. If the design cannot support a test, say so rather than quoting a number.',
      '4. **Check the robustness of the ranking.** Repeat under secondary metrics, across seeds, and on the hardest and easiest subsets. A ranking that flips under reasonable variation is reported as a tie, not a win.',
      '5. **Quantify practical significance.** Relate the delta to the meaningful range of the metric, the spread of the baseline and the added compute. A statistically real but negligible gain is described as such.',
      '6. **Attribute every comparison to its source.** For reproduced baselines cite the run directory; for cited numbers state the paper, its setting and the direction of any mismatch. Never mix reproduced and cited values in one column without labelling.',

    purpose:
      'Judge whether the experiment as executed actually produced the evidence its claims need, and locate the weakest link when it did not — the checkpoint before results become paper text.',
    whenToUse: [
      'The experiment pipeline has finished and claims are about to be written.',
      'A measured result departs from the pre-run prediction and needs scrutiny before it is trusted.',
      'A non-programmable or offline study has returned human-collected data that must be checked against the design.',
    ],
    method: [
      '1. **Restate each intended claim and the evidence it requires** — which run, which comparison, which threshold. A claim whose required evidence was never produced is marked unsupported regardless of how plausible it sounds.',
      '2. **Audit the chain for consistency.** Data, method and evaluation must line up: evaluation used the intended data version and splits and the intended metric, the model evaluated is the one the config describes, and every figure traces to a run. Locate the broken link instead of averaging over it.',
      '3. **Compare achieved against expected and investigate the gap.** Where measured results depart from the pre-run simulation or the literature, determine whether the cause is a real effect, a protocol deviation, a bug or a fallback to simulated data, and record which. A gap that cannot be explained blocks the claim.',
      '4. **Grade the evidence per claim** as strong, indicative, insufficient or contradictory, give the reason, and state the additional run that would move it up a grade.',
      '5. **Check offline and human-collected evidence against its protocol.** For non-programmable studies verify that the sample and population match the design, that instruments and procedure were followed, that ethical and data-handling requirements were met, and that raw data exists. Human-collected evidence with no raw record is not evidence.',
      '6. **Issue a verdict and a gate.** Recommend proceed, revise and rerun, or stop, naming the failed elements and the minimum change that would fix them. Never pass a claim on the strength of the surrounding narrative.',
    ],
    evidenceRequirements:
      'A traceable link from each claim to run artefacts and the metric computation, the code and data versions used, and an explicit record of deviations, fallbacks and excluded runs.
