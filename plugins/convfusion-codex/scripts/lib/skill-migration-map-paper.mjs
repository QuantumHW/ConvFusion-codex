 * 字段说明见 `skill-migration-map.mjs` 顶部。

 * ## 本分段的判断依据（Paper 模块，61 个提示词常量）
 *
 * 旧 Paper 模块的提示词是**按章节**切分的：8 个章节各一份「写这一节」的提示词，
 * 外加 storyline / quality_check / reference / polishing / latex / figure / venue。
 * 按章节切分不是**能力**切分——"写 Method" 和 "写 Abstract" 是同一种能力的两个实例。
 * 因此本表把 8 个章节 writer 合并为一个能力，把 storyline + contribution + related_work
 * 合并为"论证与定位"，把 latex + reference 合并为"提交格式化与编译修复"。
 *
 * **未**列入任何 Skill 的：各 `prompts/common_prompt.py`（LANGUAGE_MANDATE /
 * OUTPUT_RULE_BASE / CITATION_RULE / LENGTH_RULE / TONE_BASE）是跨章节共享的样板，
 * 不是能力；`paper_module_prompt.py` / `paper_dialogue_prompt.py` 是模块级与进度播报
 * 文本，同样不是能力。
 *
 * 分类学里没有用到的叶子：`academic-writing/response-to-reviewers` —— 旧 Paper 模块
 * 不存在任何审稿意见回复提示词（只有内部 quality_check 迭代），凭空造一个 Skill 会

    origin: 'paper/writing (outline, chapter_writer)',
    purpose:
      'Decide the section skeleton, the scope and length budget of each section, and the order in which sections are written — before any prose exists, so that sections cannot overlap or drift in length.',
    whenToUse: [
      'Starting a manuscript, or re-targeting an existing one from a conference template to an IEEE Transactions template.',
      'Section drafts exist but their scopes overlap, or the manuscript is under or over the page limit.',
      'You are about to write sections and need to know which evidence each one is allowed to use.',
    ],
    method: [
      '1. **Fix the venue template before the skeleton.** A 4-6 page EI conference paper merges sections and stays terse; an 8-12 page IEEE Transactions paper expects subsections and depth. Choose the template first — it determines the section count, not the reverse.',
      '2. **Write the outline as one line per section, each naming the question it answers and the artefact it draws on** (problem statement, method, results table, literature corpus). A section that cannot name its evidence is not ready to be planned.',
      '3. **Assign an explicit length budget per section** and keep a running total against the page or word limit. Record the budget numerically, because every later length check is measured against it.',
      '4. **Decide which sections split into subsections and which merge** (method: architecture, components, formulation; experiments: setup, comparison, ablation, analysis), and state the reason next to the decision.',
      '5. **Fix the writing order and the carry-forward rule.** Write in an order that satisfies dependencies, and pass already-written text forward so terminology, claims and citation keys stay consistent instead of being re-invented per section.',
      '6. **Audit the outline for duplication and omission** before drafting: two sections covering the same claim, or a claim from the narrative that no section owns, mean the skeleton is wrong.',
    ],
    evidenceRequirements:
      'The outline must be derived from the actual research state — problem, method and experiment artefacts — not from a generic template; each section line must name the artefact it will use. Section budgets must be recorded as numbers so compliance can be checked rather than argued.',

      '1. **State the arc as five linked claims**: problem context, what existing approaches do and cannot do, the specific gap, the insight that closes it, and the solution that follows. If a link needs more than one sentence, it is not yet an argument.',
      '2. **Use the gap to choose the literature, not the reverse.** Work backwards from the gap to the works that establish it, and drop works that only decorate the narrative.',
      '3. **Assign every citation a role** — establishes context, identifies the problem, shows a limitation, motivates the approach, supplies a baseline, supports a claim, establishes theory, or provides a benchmark — plus the place in the text where it is used. A citation with no role is removed.',
      '4. **Convert contributions into verifiable claims.** Each one must name what is new, what it is compared against, and which experiment or ablation demonstrates it. Drop anything that cannot be checked.',
      '5. **Write related work thematically, by mechanism family, not chronologically.** Synthesise several works per paragraph, state what the family cannot do, and reserve the closing paragraph for why existing methods do not solve the stated problem.',
      '6. **Score the narrative on explicit criteria** (arc completeness, logical coherence, citation coverage, specificity) and iterate on the lowest-scoring criterion rather than on the passages that already read well.',
      '7. **Re-check that the gap claim survives the corpus.** If a cited work already closes the gap, the contribution must be re-positioned, not re-worded.',

      '2. **Title and abstract are compression, not summary.** The title names the method and the problem in 10-15 words; the abstract states problem, method, one quantitative result and its significance, defines acronyms at first use, and carries no citations.',
      '3. **The introduction follows the narrative arc and commits early**: state the problem quickly, place the gap within the first paragraphs, introduce the method before the contributions, then close with the contributions and a short paper-organisation paragraph that matches the real outline.',
      '4. **Method explains why before what.** Describe the architecture, then each component, then the formulation and design rationale; every design choice needs a justification and enough implementation detail to reproduce it. Keep simple symbols inline in the prose and whole formulas as named equation placeholders — never emit raw display math.',
      '5. **Experiments report claim, number, interpretation.** Give a reproducible setup (data, metrics, hardware, hyperparameters), compare fairly against baselines, explain why the method wins rather than only by how much, and include an ablation that isolates each component.',
      '6. **The conclusion answers the question the introduction posed**, restates what was demonstrated, and gives concrete next steps; it introduces no new result and no new analysis.',
