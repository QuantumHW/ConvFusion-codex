# Skill: Baseline Selection & Comparison Protocol

## Purpose

Choose the comparisons that make a result meaningful: the strongest published methods on the same task plus trivial and structural controls, each run under one protocol so differences are attributable to the method.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- A new method is proposed and must be placed against the state of the art.
- The candidate baseline list consists of whatever was easiest to reimplement.
- Expected baseline numbers are needed before implementation to judge whether the expected gain justifies the work.

## Research Method

1. **Derive the comparison from the claim.** The baseline must differ from your method in exactly the factor the contribution claims. If it differs in data, tuning budget or compute, the comparison does not test the claim.
2. **Cover the tiers.** Include at least a trivial reference (majority class, random, last value), a standard strong method, the current state of the art in this exact setting, and a variant of your own method with the contribution removed. A baseline set that omits the strongest published method is not a comparison.
3. **Source each baseline from a paper, not from intuition.** Record the paper, its reported values and the exact setting (data version, split, metric definition, compute), and flag every mismatch with your setting. Values you had to estimate must be marked as estimates.
4. **Freeze one evaluation protocol.** Same data version, splits, preprocessing, metric implementation and tuning budget for every method. Unequal tuning is the most common way comparisons become unfair; state the protocol once and apply it verbatim.
5. **Pre-compute expected results and a decision margin.** Give each baseline realistic expected values with a plausible range, and decide in advance how large a gap counts as a real improvement rather than run-to-run variation. If the predicted margin is not clearly above that threshold, revisit the design before implementing.
6. **Specify what the implementation must guarantee.** Each baseline must run from a documented config, use the shared data pipeline and metric code, and emit raw predictions so the comparison can be recomputed. Anything not faithfully reimplementable is reported as cited-only rather than silently approximated.

## Reasoning Guidance

<!-- 迁移自旧模块提示词；具体推理要点见下方逐字来源。 -->

## Evidence Requirements

For every baseline: the source paper or implementation with a link, the protocol it was run under, its config, and its raw outputs. Reported baseline numbers must be either reproduced locally or explicitly attributed to the source with setting differences noted.

## Expected Output

Produce:

- baseline set organised by tier, with the justification for each member
- per-baseline source and expected metric range
- one frozen comparison protocol applied to all methods
- the pre-declared improvement margin
- implementation requirements per baseline, including cited-only entries

## Source Prompts (verbatim from ConvFusion)

These are the original module prompts this skill was reorganised from — preserved as
accumulated research intelligence, not as an execution contract. They reference state keys
(`{research_topic}`, `{plans_json}`, …) that no longer exist in v2; read them for the method,
not for a pipeline.

Your task is to design appropriate baselines and test cases for this experiment.

## Part 1: Baseline Methods
Design 3-5 baseline methods that represent the state-of-the-art or relevant comparisons:

For each baseline, specify:
1. **Name**: Descriptive name of the baseline method
2. **Description**: Brief description of the method
3. **Source**: Which paper or method it's based on
4. **Expected Performance**: Estimated performance on the evaluation metrics
5. **Implementation Notes**: How it could be implemented

## Part 2: Test Cases
Design test cases to validate the experiment:

1. **Standard Test Cases**: Typical scenarios the experiment should handle
2. **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and challenging scenarios
3. **Validation Criteria**: How to determine if the experiment is successful

Return a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{{
  "baselines": [
    {{
      "name": "string",
      "description": "string",
      "source": "string",
      "expected_metrics": {{
        "metric1": value1,
        "metric2": value2
      }},
      "implementation_notes": "string"
    }}
  ],
  "test_cases": [
    {{
      "name": "string",
      "description": "string",
      "scenario": "string",
      "expected_outcome": "string",
      "validation_criteria": "string"
    }}
  ]
}}
```

Guidelines:
1. Baselines should be relevant to the research topic and experiment type
2. Expected metrics should be realistic based on literature
3. Test cases should cover both standard and edge scenarios
4. Consider computational feasibility of implementing baselines
5. Include at least one simple baseline for comparison

Return ONLY the JSON object, no extra text or explanation.

```text
You are an expert ML researcher. Your role is to specify baseline method requirements for a research experiment.

You do NOT generate code. You produce a structured specification that will be handed to a coding system for implementation.

========================
# Research Context
========================

Research Topic: {research_topic}

Experiment Design:
{experiment_design}

========================
# Your Task
========================

Define baseline methods specification. Describe:

1. **Objective**: What comparison should the baselines enable?
2. **Baseline Methods**: List each baseline method with brief description
3. **Comparison Requirements**: How should baselines be compared (same dataset, same metrics, same splits, etc.)
4. **Evaluation Protocol**: How should each baseline be evaluated?

========================
# Output Format
========================

Format your response as a JSON object:
{{
    "baselines": {{
        "objective": "Clear one-sentence description of the comparison goal",
        "baseline_methods": [
            "Method 1: brief description",
            "Method 2: brief description"
        ],
        "comparison_requirements": [
            "same dataset",
            "same evaluation metrics"
        ],
        "evaluation_protocol": [
            "Protocol 1: description",
            "Protocol 2: description"

You are an expert baseline result generator for scientific experiments. Your task has TWO parts:

**Part 1**: Generate simulated baseline results based on core papers from the literature review
**Part 2**: Create test cases that will guide code implementation and verify results against baselines

========================
# Research Context
========================

Research Topic: {research_topic}

Core Papers (from Discovery module):
{core_papers}

Experiment Design:
{experiment_design}

========================
# Part 1: Generate Baseline Results
========================

{full_text_context}

Baseline Methods to simulate:
{baseline_methods}

Evaluation Metrics:
{primary_metric} (primary) + {evaluation_metrics}

For each baseline method, generate results that:
1. Are realistic and consistent with the paper descriptions
2. Follow the expected format of experiment results
3. Include the primary metric and all secondary metrics

========================
# Part 2: Generate Dataset Information
========================

Based on the research topic and core papers, identify key datasets used in this research area.
For each dataset, provide:
1. Dataset name and description
2. Key characteristics (size, domain, language, etc.)
3. Relevant paper references (if available in core papers)
4. How each baseline method typically uses this dataset

Common datasets in this field: {common_datasets}

========================
# Part 3: Create Test Cases
========================

Create Python test cases that verify the implementation can achieve results comparable to these baselines.
These test cases will be used by the coding environment to guide code development.

Each test case should specify:
1. What to test (functionality, metric achievement)
2. Input data format (referencing the datasets above)
3. Expected output threshold compared to baseline
4. How to validate the result

========================
