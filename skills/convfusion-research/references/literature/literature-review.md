# Skill: Literature Review

## Purpose

Build an evidence-backed understanding of a research area — tasks, problems, methods, evidence, contradictions — rather than a list of paper summaries.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- You need to know what the field actually knows before proposing anything.
- A direction is being considered and its novelty depends on what already exists.
- You are assembling the related-work argument.

## Research Method

1. **Extract per paper on fixed dimensions** (problem, method, evidence, limitation) so that papers become comparable rather than merely summarised.
2. **Group by mechanism, not by terminology.** Two papers with different names for the same idea are one method family.
3. **Surface contradictions explicitly.** Where two works disagree, the disagreement is the most valuable output of the review.
4. **Identify the dominant direction and why it dominates** — the field's consensus is the baseline any contribution is measured against.
5. **Separate admitted limitations from inferred ones**, and keep the inference labelled as yours.

## Reasoning Guidance

## Evidence Requirements

Every extracted claim must be traceable to a specific work and location. Contradictions must cite both sides. Do not generalise from a single paper to "the field".

## Expected Output

Produce:

- per-paper extraction on the fixed dimensions
- method families with their representative works
- explicit contradictions with both sides cited
- the dominant direction and the reason it dominates

## Source Prompts (verbatim from ConvFusion)

These are the original module prompts this skill was reorganised from — preserved as
accumulated research intelligence, not as an execution contract. They reference state keys
(`{research_topic}`, `{plans_json}`, …) that no longer exist in v2; read them for the method,
not for a pipeline.
