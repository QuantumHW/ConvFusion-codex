# Skill: Research Topic Ranking

## Purpose

Rank candidate research topics on separated dimensions and state the reasoning, so that the choice can be revisited rather than re-argued.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- Several candidate topics exist and one must be chosen.
- A topic is being questioned and it is unclear whether to continue or change.
- The user has stated preferences (risk, timeline, venue) that should constrain the choice.

## Research Method

1. **Enumerate all candidates first**, including weak ones — a candidate never written down cannot be compared.
2. **Score on separated dimensions**: novelty, feasibility, expected impact, cost, risk. A single blended score hides exactly the trade-off the decision turns on.
3. **Apply the user's preferences as constraints, not tie-breakers.** If low risk is prioritised, a high-ceiling high-variance topic fails regardless of ceiling — and say so.
4. **Find the critical path** for each candidate: the single dependency that, if unavailable, kills it.
5. **Prefer topics that survive their own failure** — a negative result that still informs beats a failure that yields nothing.
6. **Record the ranking with its reasoning and the preferences that drove it**, so it can be reconsidered when assumptions change.

## Reasoning Guidance

## Evidence Requirements

Feasibility claims should reference what makes them feasible. Risk claims should name the specific failure. Novelty claims should cite the gap analysis or literature that establishes them.

## Expected Output

Produce:

- all candidates, including rejected ones
- per-dimension scores rather than one aggregate
- critical path and fallback per leading candidate
- the ranking with the reasoning and driving preferences

## Source Prompts (verbatim from ConvFusion)

These are the original module prompts this skill was reorganised from — preserved as
accumulated research intelligence, not as an execution contract. They reference state keys
(`{research_topic}`, `{plans_json}`, …) that no longer exist in v2; read them for the method,
not for a pipeline.

### `modules/initiation/incubation/prompts/rank_topics_prompt.py` — TEMPLATE

```text
You are a research topic ranker. Evaluate and rank the generated research topics.

Generated Topics:
{generated_topics}

Evaluate each topic on:
1. Scientific significance
2. Feasibility
3. Novelty
4. Alignment with user interests

Return the top topics sorted by overall quality.

CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT RULES:
1. Output ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no explanation, no extra text.
2. DO NOT wrap JSON in code blocks or any other markers.
3. candidate_topics must be an array of topic objects.
4. Each topic object must have exactly these 4 fields: title, motivation, research_question, confidence.
5. confidence must be a FLOAT between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive, where 1.0 = highest quality.

You are a research opportunity analyst. Analyze the research seed and identify research opportunities.

Research Seed:
{research_seed}

Identify specific research opportunities based on:
1. Problems mentioned and their significance
2. Limitations of current approaches
3. Future work directions suggested
4. Research signals detected
