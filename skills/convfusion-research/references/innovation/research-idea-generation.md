# Skill: Research Idea Generation

## Purpose

Produce a portfolio of genuinely distinct candidate research ideas, each attacking a named gap through a stated mechanism — instead of several rewordings of one idea.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- A ranked set of gaps exists and you need candidate ways to close them.
- An existing idea list looks broad but every entry shares the same mechanism.
- You need cross-domain candidates and want their validity conditions made explicit.

## Research Method

1. **Fix the generation target before generating.** For each gap write the one-sentence change in capability the idea must produce. An idea that cannot state this is a restatement of existing work, however appealing it sounds.
2. **Generate across mechanisms, not within one.** For each gap, produce candidates from at least three different mechanism families — change the representation, change the training signal, change the inference procedure, change the evaluation setting. Mechanism diversity is what makes the later portfolio decision meaningful.
3. **Force cross-domain transfer to declare itself.** For at least one candidate per gap, name the source field and the imported mechanism, then state what must be re-derived for the import to be valid. Unexamined analogy is the most common source of fake novelty.
4. **Check the closest work while writing the idea, not after.** If you cannot name what differs from the nearest existing method and why that difference should matter, drop the candidate rather than keeping it with vague novelty language.
5. **State the falsifiable claim for each idea.** Write the observation that would show it does not work. An idea whose claim cannot fail is not researchable; it is a programme of work.
6. **Keep the idea separate from its implementation.** Record mechanism and claim only. Architecture, dataset and schedule belong to planning, and committing to them now silently deletes alternatives.
7. **Stop at coverage, not at a count.** Stop when every selected gap has at least one candidate from each plausible mechanism family; report the gaps that produced nothing and why, rather than padding the list.

## Reasoning Guidance

## Evidence Requirements

Each idea must reference the gap it addresses and the closest work it must be distinguished from. Any cross-domain import must name its source and what was re-derived. No idea may be justified by trend or popularity alone.

## Expected Output

Produce:

- candidate ideas, each with its gap, mechanism family and core claim
- the closest-work comparison that distinguishes each idea
- a falsification condition per idea
- cross-domain imports with their validity conditions
- gaps that yielded no viable candidate, with the reason

## Source Prompts (verbatim from ConvFusion)

These are the original module prompts this skill was reorganised from — preserved as
accumulated research intelligence, not as an execution contract. They reference state keys
(`{research_topic}`, `{plans_json}`, …) that no longer exist in v2; read them for the method,
not for a pipeline.

```text
You are an expert in scientific innovation and research idea generation. Based on the identified innovation opportunities for the specific research topic below, generate high-quality research ideas:

Research Topic: {research_topic}

1. Generate 5-10 distinct research ideas
2. Each idea should address identified gaps and opportunities
3. Encourage cross-domain innovation and novel approaches
4. Each idea must have clear motivation and core innovation

Innovation Opportunities:
{innovation_opportunities}

Deep Research Gaps:
{deep_research_gaps}

Research Understanding:
{research_understanding}

Please return the ideas in JSON format:
{{
    "candidate_ideas": [
        {{
            "id": "idea_1",
            "title": "brief, specific title",
            "motivation": "why this research is needed",
            "core_innovation": "what's novel about this approach",
            "expected_contribution": "expected contribution",
            "technical_direction": "technical approach"
        }}
    ]
}}

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Generate AT LEAST 5-10 distinct ideas
2. Each idea must be specific, actionable, and researchable
3. Focus on real innovation, not just incremental improvements
4. Address the identified research gaps and opportunities
5. Include a mix of theoretical and applied approaches
6. Encourage cross-domain thinking and novel combinations
7. Each idea should have clear, well-articulated motivation
8. Avoid generic or vague ideas - focus on concrete, specific research directions
