# Skill: Idea Novelty Assessment

## Purpose

Judge how much of an idea is actually new by locating each claim-bearing part of it against the closest prior work, rather than scoring novelty from the proposal wording.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- An idea is a candidate for commitment and its novelty must be defended.
- You suspect prior art exists but cannot tell which part of the idea it touches.
- A reviewer or collaborator claims the idea is a known technique under a new name.

## Research Method

1. **Never assess novelty from the proposal text alone.** Retrieve the nearest works first. Novelty is a relation between the idea and the literature, not a property of the write-up.
2. **Decompose the idea into claim-bearing parts** — problem formulation, mechanism, training or evaluation procedure, and setting. Attribute each part to prior work or to the proposal. Most ideas are novel in one part and derivative in the rest; say which part is which.
3. **Name the closest work per part and the exact difference.** A difference counts as a novelty claim only if you can state what it changes measurably — accuracy under a regime, cost, sample efficiency, scope of applicability.
4. **Classify the novelty type:** new problem, new mechanism, new combination, new setting or regime, or new evidence about an existing method. For combination novelty, argue non-triviality: why the parts do not compose without new work.
5. **Run the obvious-extension test.** Ask whether a competent researcher who had read the closest work would produce this as the next routine step. If yes, the novelty is incremental, and it is better to say so than to inflate it.
6. **Compare against the current state of the art, not the field entry point.** Reviewers compare with the strongest recent result; comparing with an old baseline manufactures novelty that will not survive review.
7. **Report novelty as a claim with its support**, including the prior art that could not be excluded because of search limits. Absence of evidence is not evidence of novelty.

## Reasoning Guidance

## Evidence Requirements

Every differentiating claim must cite the specific work it differs from and the location of the relevant method or result in it. Unresolved prior art must be flagged rather than omitted. No novelty claim may rest on the result of a single search.

## Expected Output

Produce:

- per-part attribution of the idea to prior work or to the proposal
- the closest work per part with the exact measurable difference
- novelty type, including a non-triviality argument for combinations
- an incremental-versus-structural judgement with its reasoning
- prior art that could not be ruled out

## Source Prompts (verbatim from ConvFusion)

These are the original module prompts this skill was reorganised from — preserved as
accumulated research intelligence, not as an execution contract. They reference state keys
(`{research_topic}`, `{plans_json}`, …) that no longer exist in v2; read them for the method,
not for a pipeline.

Evaluate the novelty of the following research proposal:

Idea:
{idea}

Method:
{method}

Related research context:
- Number of related papers found: {related_papers}
- Research paths: {research_paths}
- Current insights: {current_insights}

Please assess how novel this proposal is compared to existing research. Consider:
1. How different is the approach from existing methods?
2. Does it address a new problem or a new aspect of an existing problem?
3. Are there similar approaches in the literature?
4. Level of innovation and originality
5. Potential to advance the field beyond current state-of-the-art
6. Uniqueness of the proposed methodology

```text
You are an expert in research evaluation and scientific assessment. Evaluate each of the candidate research ideas based on multiple dimensions:

Research Topic: {research_topic}

1. Novelty (0.0-1.0): How innovative and original is this idea?
2. Feasibility (0.0-1.0): How realistic and implementable is this approach?
3. Scientific Value (0.0-1.0): What is the potential scientific impact?
4. Publication Potential (0.0-1.0): What is the likelihood of publication?
5. Implementation Complexity (0.0-1.0): How complex is the implementation?
6. Overall Score (0.0-1.0): Weighted combination of the above

Candidate Ideas:
{candidate_ideas}

Innovation Opportunities:
{innovation_opportunities}

Research Understanding:
{research_understanding}

Please return the evaluation in JSON format:
{{
    "evaluated_ideas": [
        {{
            "id": "idea_1",

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Evaluate ALL provided ideas
2. Provide realistic, well-justified scores
3. Scores should be between 0.0 and 1.0
4. Overall score should be a weighted combination (e.g., novelty=0.3, scientific_value=0.3, feasibility=0.2, publication_potential=0.2)
5. Include clear rationale for the evaluation
